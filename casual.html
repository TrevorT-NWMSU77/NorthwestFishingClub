        <h2>Are you a beginner and just learning how to fish?</h2>
        <p>If you're a beginning angler and wanting to learn how to fish certain conditions and what kinds of baits to use, this is the place for you. We host weekly meeting on Tuesdays in Valk 117 where we go over more of the "classroom" topics. In the past we have had conservationists to talk about the statistics of our local fishing spots as well as some spots around Missouri. There is a wide range of information available for our members.</p>
        <h2>Where Do We Fish Locally?</h2>
        <p>We are lucky to have access to multiple good fishing spots close to northwest. The spot that we normally fish is the water treatment plant in town. Another common spot is Nodaway Lake that is located a few minutes north of Maryville.</p>
